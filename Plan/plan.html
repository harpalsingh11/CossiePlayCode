<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>The goal of this website is increase the number of members(party-goers) in CossiePlay. We intend to spread more awareness about Cosplay to younger audience. </p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>The success of the website can be evaluated by measuring the change in <br/>
1. Quantity of audience (it should be increased).<br/>
2. Change in type of audience (since we are targetting high school kids and young adults, therefore their count should increase.) <br/>
</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>We are targetting audience of younger age, especially high school kids and young adults. As they might not be familiar with Cosplay, therefore we have put images, guidelines and links on the website so that they get an idea of what cosplay is.</p>
